Hello, my name is Michael.

In this about me I'd like to give a small background in my educational experience and what I aim to do with my GitHub page.

// Who I am //
I'm a junior software developer, (I've had this degree for so long I don't think I can be considered a graduate anymore), and I primarily enjoy programming applications in C# and Python.
I am aiming to broaden my capabilities, I have tried to expand into website design and development, picking up my skillset from university.

// What I want to do //
I want to use this GitHub as my primary portfolio to prove my capabilities and to develop my experience. I hope this page serves as a journal of sorts to document my progress and my journey into software development.
