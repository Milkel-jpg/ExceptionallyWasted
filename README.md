Hello!

# Who am I?
I'm a Welsh junior software developer currently based in Greater Manchester, England. I'm looking to prove and show off my practical skills in the hopes of getting a foothold in the software development industry.

I currently work part-time to keep the bills afloat and in my spare time if I'm not playing video games I'm usually creating something, I really enjoy back-end development but I am also seeking to develop skills in full-stack and front-end development.

This GitHub is to serve as a portfolio of sorts to show off the projects I'm currently working on and what direction I want to take them in.
